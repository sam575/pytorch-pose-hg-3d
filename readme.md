# Optimal camera viewpoint classifier

The code is adapted from the following <a href="https://github.com/xingyizhou/pytorch-pose-hg-3d">repository</a> 

for the network presented in 
> Xingyi Zhou, Qixing Huang, Xiao Sun, Xiangyang Xue, Yichen Wei, 
> *Towards 3D Human Pose Estimation in the Wild: a Weakly-supervised Approach*
> ICCV 2017 ([arXiv:1704.02447](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02447))


The code is implementation of Approach 1 as discussed in the report

-  Single-view camera viewpoint classifier:
```
python main_ocv.py
```


- Multi-view camera viewpoint classifier:
```
python main_ocj.py
```
